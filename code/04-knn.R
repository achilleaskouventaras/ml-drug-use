#Unlike regular plots with one axis pair, biplots have two sets. 

#The first set (usually the left-most and bottom vertical and horizontal axes) 
#shows principal component (PC) scores for subjects.
#The second set (usually the right most and top vertical and horizontal axes) 
#displays variable loadings on PCs. 
#These are visualized by arrows originating from the plot center, 
#with lengths proportional to the variable's weight on each PC.
